This repository contains my solutions to the first few days of the Advent of Code challenge.
These exercises are used for the technical assessment of my application for the position of R&D Controls and Machine Learning Engineer at Wandercraft.

Results are available in the Result.txt document, as well as input data for each exercices.

The planned improvements are the adding of C++ solutions, the adding of the following exercices and the optimisation of codes.
